      <h2>Minaret of Jam: The Spiral Tower of Celestial Geometry</h2>
      <p>
        Standing in eerie isolation, this 12th-century marvel reflects mathematical genius
        and cosmic alignment. Linked by legend to the lost city of Firozkoh, this monument
        whispers secrets of the stars. Could its spiral form be more than just architecture—
        a resonant structure for frequencies we’ve yet to understand?

      <h2>Tepe Fullol: Gold from the Stars?</h2>
      <p>
        Dating back to 2000 BCE, Tepe Fullol’s unearthed treasures shimmer with mystery.
        Early metallurgy and intricate design hint at knowledge beyond its time. Was this
        a node in an ancient global network? Some believe it was part of a forgotten golden age.

      <h2>Aï Khanoum: The Greek City in the East</h2>

        and Vedic mysticism. Its lost libraries and astronomical tools suggest something beyond
        mere conquest—perhaps an ancient experiment in cosmic governance?
